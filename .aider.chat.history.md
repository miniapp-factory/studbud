StudyMate – A quiz that helps someone discover study methods that suit their current learning preferences (for example: Pomodoro Technique, Feynman Technique, Active Recall, Spaced Repetition, Blurting Method, Cornell Note-Taking Method, Mind Mapping, Interleaving Technique, SQ3R Method, Leitner System) by answering 10 multiple-choice questions with 5 choices each. Generate an image for each study method in a cute cartoon vector style, with brief examples of each study method displayed on the result page. The results should reflect the user’s answers dynamically and update if they retake the quiz. Allow the user to retake the quiz as many times as they want. Write the questions and answers yourself. Randomize the order of the answers for each question. Place the quiz on the home page.

The following files in your repository are the ones that will most likely need to be edited or added in order to implement the requested quiz app, generate the study‑method images, and update the app logo and metadata:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **mini-app/app/page.tsx** – import and render the new quiz component on the home page.  
3. **mini-app/components/quiz.tsx** – create this new component that contains the 10‑question quiz, randomizes answer order, displays results, and allows retakes.  
4. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create this file to generate the app logo.  
5. **mini-app/public/pomodoro.png.todo** – create this file to generate the Pomodoro Technique image.  
6. **mini-app/public/feynman.png.todo** – create this file to generate the Feynman Technique image.  
7. **mini-app/public/active-recall.png.todo** – create this file to generate the Active Recall image.  
8. **mini-app/public/spaced-repetition.png.todo** – create this file to generate the Spaced Repetition image.  
9. **mini-app/public/blurting.png.todo** – create this file to generate the Blurting Method image.  
10. **mini-app/public/cornell.png.todo** – create this file to generate the Cornell Note‑Taking Method image.  
11. **mini-app/public/mind-mapping.png.todo** – create this file to generate the Mind Mapping image.  
12. **mini-app/public/interleaving.png.todo** – create this file to generate the Interleaving Technique image.  
13. **mini-app/public/sq3r.png.todo** – create this file to generate the SQ3R Method image.  
14. **mini-app/public/leitner.png.todo** – create this file to generate the Leitner System image.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks (or new‑file blocks) to implement the changes.
